## 🔄 Demo Application Status

The demo application has some dependency resolution issues that are common when upgrading React versions with older react-scripts. These issues are related to webpack/build tooling compatibility and don't affect the core library functionality.

### Demo Issues
- ❌ Build/start fails due to `ajv` dependency conflicts
- ❌ Requires additional dependency resolution for react-scripts v5

### Recommended Demo Fixes (for future work)
1. Update to a more modern build system (Vite, Next.js, or newer CRA)
2. Or use `--legacy-peer-deps` and additional dependency overrides
3. Or create a new demo with modern tooling

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The library maintains full compatibility with React 17 and 18
2. **Future Ready**: Now supports React 19 out of the box
3. **Modern Dependencies**: All dependencies updated to latest stable versions
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained
5. **Build Success**: Library builds successfully with all updates
